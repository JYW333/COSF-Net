# COSF-Net
---

## Overview

This repository contains the core source code for the paper listed above.

Wild feline behavior recognition in field settings is challenged by
camouflage backgrounds, large scale variations across species, occlusion,
and low-light conditions. We propose **COSF-Net**, a Collaborative SlowFast
Network that integrates a **Heterogeneous Attention Feature Fusion (HAFF)**
module composed of two novel 3D attention sub-modules:

| Module | Role in HAFF |
|--------|-------------|
| **MS-FCA-3D** (Multi-Scale Fine-grained Channel Attention 3D) | Fast→Slow direction: multi-scale spatial pyramid + gated residual fusion for scale adaptation and noise suppression |
| **DC-BiFormer-3D** (Dynamic Context Bi-level Routing Attention 3D) | Slow→Fast direction: dynamic window predictor + spatio-temporal context fusion for adaptive receptive field and global context compensation |

### Main Results

| Dataset | Top-1 Acc | Params | FLOPs |
|---------|-----------|--------|-------|
| Animal Kingdom (feline subset) | **83.12%** | lower than baselines | lower than baselines |
| MammalNet (feline subset) | **64.30%** | lower than baselines | lower than baselines |

Outperforms SlowFast, Dual-SlowFast, MViTv2, VideoMAEV2, UniFormerV2, and others.

## Dependencies

**Python**: 3.8  
**CUDA**: 11.3

Install PyTorch first (must match your CUDA version):
```bash
pip install torch==1.12.1+cu113 torchvision==0.13.1+cu113 \
    --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu113
```

Then install remaining dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Note: `torch` and `torchvision` in `requirements.txt` are listed for
reference. Install them via the command above to ensure CUDA compatibility.

## Quick Start
```python
import torch
from models.custom_attention_3d import MultiScaleFCALayer3D, DynamicContextBiFormer3D

# MS-FCA-3D
x = torch.randn(2, 64, 8, 56, 56)   # [B, C, T, H, W]
ms_fca = MultiScaleFCALayer3D(channel=64, num_scales=3)
out = ms_fca(x)   # shape: [2, 64, 8, 56, 56]

# DC-BiFormer-3D
dc_bi = DynamicContextBiFormer3D(dim=64, num_heads=8, base_win=7, topk=4)
out = dc_bi(x)    # shape: [2, 64, 8, 56, 56]
```
